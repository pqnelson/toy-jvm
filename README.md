# toy-jvm

A toy example demonstrating the architecture of a JVM.

## Installation

Simply clone this from `https://github.com/pqnelson/toy-jvm.git`, open
up a command line, and type in `lein run` to start running a toy program.

I will be documenting the major components either on my github page or
in the `/doc/` directory. But the tests should demonstrate each
function, I hope.
